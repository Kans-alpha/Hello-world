# Hello-world
I am redoing it from start, let's go all ot to succeed this time. My sincier prayers to allmighty forces around, please help me succeed.  Amen.
Everything is difficult, before it becomes easy. 
The game - Snake used to be difficult for me a week ago. I practiced it daily. Now, after a week, i can easily make over 40 points. Yesterday night i made 50. 
That's the clue Kans, practice daily. 
Keep working on smaller chunks daily. 
You will succeed at whatever you wish to achieve. 
SO, draw and outline of your dream destination.  --> on sidetrack, ignore Sandra drinking her water so LOUDLY, , GULP...GUPL...  SLUrrP
ignore it, it's not worth your time. 
Once you have the outline, say of becoming Data scientist, schedule activities with milestones.
Then, commit yourslef to the performing the daily drill.
See-it, Believe it, Commit to it.
